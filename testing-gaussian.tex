The goal of this short note is to record tight bounds on various testing problems for $\dims$-dimensional Gaussians. Let $\q$ denote the standard Gaussian, i.e., $\q\eqdef \gaussian{\mathbf{0}}{I_\dims}$. Any mistake or imprecision is mine.

That is, to output $\widehat{\Sigma}$ such that $\norm{\Sigma^{-1/2}\widehat{\Sigma}\Sigma^{-1/2}-I_\dims}_F \leq \dst$. This also has sample complexity $\bigTheta{\dims^2/\dst^2}$, also achieved by the empirical covariance matrix, and is useful for learning a high-dimensional Gaussian in total variation distance (essentially, we are considering Frobenius here, instead of that relative Frobenius distance, because we specialized this to the case we are focusing on: the reference distribution has identity covariance).}
\end{problem}
\hfill \textbf{Sample complexity:} $\bigTheta{\kappa^2\dims^2/\dst^2}$. 

Finally, this one will be rather useful to prove lower bounds, as we will see later, but also makes sense by itself~--~who has never wanted to test whether the vector of eigenvalues of a covariance matrix had large $\lp[2]$ norm?

\section{A crucial fact}
The starting point of many of those results will be that the total variation distance between two high-dimensional Gaussians~--~and thus, a fortiori, the distance to the standard one, $\q$~-- is characterized by the appropriate distances between their parameters:
\begin{fact}
  \label{fact:tv:parameters}
  Let $\p\eqdef\gaussian{\mu}{\Sigma}$. Then
  $
      \totalvardist{\p}{\q} \leq 2\max\mleft(  \normtwo{\mu}, \norm{\Sigma-I_\dims}_F \mright)\,.
  $
  Conversely, we have $\totalvardist{\p}{\q} \geq C\min(1,\max\mleft(  \normtwo{\mu}, \norm{\Sigma-I_\dims}_F \mright))$, for some absolute constant $C>0$.
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}
There are many references for this, with various degrees of complexity and tightness of the constants; see, e.g.,~\cite[Corollary~1.4.6]{Li2018}, or~\cite[Theorem~1.3]{DevroyeMR2018}. We here give a self-contained proof of the upper bound.\footnote{But would be delighted to be pointed to a simple proof of the general statement, as we do not particularly care about obtaining the tightest constants possible.}
We start by the (exact) expression of the Kullback--Leibler divergence between $\p$ and $\q$. Denoting the $\dims$ eigenvalues of $\Sigma$ by $0\leq \lambda_1\leq \dots\leq \lambda_\dims$, we have, using the ``folklore'' expression for the divergence between two arbitrary multivariate Gaussians,\footnote{Folklore, in that case, is synonymous with Wikipedia~\cite{wiki:KL}.}
\[
  \kldiv{\p}{\q} 
  = \frac{1}{2}\mleft(  \normtwo{\mu}^2 + \operatorname{Tr}\Sigma -\dims - \log \det \Sigma \mright)
  = \frac{1}{2}\mleft(  \normtwo{\mu}^2 + \sum_{i=1}^\dims (\lambda_i - 1 - \log \lambda_i) \mright)
\]
Assume for now (we will argue later why it is safe to do so) that $\abs{\lambda_i - 1}\leq 1/2$ for all $i$. In that case, since the very convenient inequality\footnote{Which is inspired by looking at the Taylor expansion of $\log$ around $1$: $\log x = (x-1) - \frac{1}{2}(x-1)^2 + o((x-1)^2)$.}
$
  x-1 \leq \log x + (x-1)^2
$ holds for all $x\geq 1/2$, and 
we get 
\[
  \kldiv{\p}{\q} \leq  \frac{1}{2}\mleft(  \normtwo{\mu}^2 + \sum_{i=1}^\dims (\lambda_i - 1)^2 \mright) = \frac{1}{2}\mleft(  \normtwo{\mu}^2 + \norm{\Sigma-I_\dims}_F^2 \mright)
  \leq \max\mleft(  \normtwo{\mu}^2, \norm{\Sigma-I_\dims}_F^2 \mright)\,,
\]
where we used that, for positive semi-definite matrices the Frobenius norm is the $\lp[2]$ norm of the vector of eigenvalues. Now, by Pinsker's inequality, we get
\[
    \totalvardist{\p}{\q} \leq \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\kldiv{\p}{\q}} \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\max\mleft(  \normtwo{\mu}, \norm{\Sigma-I_\dims}_F \mright)
\]
which gives the claim. Almost: it remains to explain why we could assume that $\abs{\lambda_i - 1}\leq 1/2$ for all $i$. This is just because, otherwise, we have
$\norm{\Sigma-I_\dims}_F \geq \max_{1\leq i \leq \dims} \abs{\lambda_i - 1} > 1/2$, and since the total variation distance is always at most one we have $\totalvardist{\p}{\q} < 2\norm{\Sigma-I_\dims}_F$, and the claim holds as well.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bonus useless stuff! %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% To see that, suppose without loss of generality that $\abs{\lambda_1 - 1} > 1/2$, let $v$ be the eigenvector associated with $\lambda_1$. Let $\p'$ be the (Gaussian) distribution of $\dotprod{X}{v}$ when $X\sim\p$, and $\q'$ the same thing for $\q$: note that $\p'=\gaussian{0}{1}$ and $\q'=\gaussian{\dotprod{\mu}{v}}{\lambda_1}$. We then have
% \[
%     \totalvardist{\p}{\q} \geq \totalvardist{\p'}{\q'} \geq \frac{1}{2}\totalvardist{\p'^{\otimes 2}}{\q'^{\otimes 2}} = \frac{1}{2}\totalvardist{\gaussian{0}{\lambda_1}}{\gaussian{0}{1}}
% \]
% where the first inequality is the data processing inequality (DPI), the second is subadditivity of total variation distance,\footnote{That is, in general, $\totalvardist{\p_1\otimes\p_2}{\q_1\otimes\q_2} \leq \totalvardist{\p_1}{\q_1}+\totalvardist{\p_2}{\q_2}$, as a consequence of the triangle inequality.} and the third is again the DPI by using the transformation $f(x,y)=\frac{x-y}{\sqrt{2}}$ and noting that the distribution of $f(X,Y)$ for $(X,Y)\sim\p'^{\otimes 2}$ (resp., $(X,Y)\sim\q'^{\otimes 2}$) is exactly $\gaussian{0}{\lambda_1}$ (resp., $\gaussian{0}{1}$). Why did we do all this? Because now, lower bounding $\totalvardist{\gaussian{0}{\lambda_1}}{\gaussian{0}{1}}$ is (relatively) easy: by lower bounding the integral defining the total variation distance, one can check that this is at least some absolute constant; specifically,
% \[
% \totalvardist{\gaussian{0}{\lambda_1}}{\gaussian{0}{1}} \geq \min\mleft(\totalvardist{\gaussian{0}{1/2}}{\gaussian{0}{1}},\totalvardist{\gaussian{0}{3/2}}{\gaussian{0}{1}}\mright) \geq 0.387\,.
% \]
\end{proof}
\emph{Why} do we care about this? This will help us find relations between the problems considered, of the type ``if I have an algorithm for problem $A$, then I can use it to solve problem $B$ with the same sample complexity''~--~in turn allowing us to only prove a few bounds and get the whole picture. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Relationship between problems}
For instance, suppose that we are under the identity-covariance assumption, i.e., promised that $\Sigma=I_\dims$ for the unknown Gaussian $\p$. Then $\p=\q$ is equivalent to $\mu=\mathbf{0}$, and by~\autoref{fact:tv:parameters} we now know that $\totalvardist{\p}{\q}>\dst$ implies $\normtwo{\mu}>\dst/2$. So we have the following (where $A \preceq B$ means ``$A$ requires at most as many samples as $B$''):
\[
      \text{\autoref{problem:tv:identitycov}} \preceq \text{\autoref{problem:mean:identitycov}} \preceq \text{\autoref{problem:mean:identitycov:learn}}
\]
We also have the other following relations:
\[
      \text{\autoref{problem:tv:identitycov}} \preceq \text{\autoref{problem:tv:general}}
\]
(as an algorithm for the more general problem~\autoref{problem:tv:general} can be used for the more specific~\autoref{problem:tv:identitycov}); as well as
\[
      \text{\autoref{problem:tv:identitycov}} \preceq \text{\autoref{problem:mean:testing:standard}}
\]
(because again of~\autoref{fact:tv:parameters}; can you see why?). Finally, we also have
\[
    \text{\autoref{problem:cov:learn:norm:op}} \preceq \text{\autoref{problem:cov:learn:op}}, \qquad \text{\autoref{problem:cov:test:norm:frob}} \preceq \text{\autoref{problem:cov:learn:norm:frob}} \preceq \text{\autoref{problem:cov:learn:frob}}
\]
(again, check you see why~--~the idea is that learning the parameter implies learning its norm which implies testing its magnitude), and
\[
    \text{\autoref{problem:cov:learn:norm:op}} \preceq \text{\autoref{problem:cov:learn:norm:frob}}, \qquad \text{\autoref{problem:cov:learn:op}} \preceq \text{\autoref{problem:cov:learn:frob}}
\]
this time because $\norm{\cdot}_{\rm op}\leq \norm{\cdot}_{F}$. See~\autoref{fig:relations} for a colorful illustration.

\begin{figure}\centering
  \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{testing-gaussian-fig}
  \caption{\label{fig:relations}Relationships between the different problems considered here (and one extra, in the middle)}
\end{figure}

\begin{remark}
  There is also some relation between~\autoref{problem:tv:general} and the combination (\autoref{problem:mean:testing:standard}+~\autoref{problem:cov:test:norm:frob}), but it is less obvious and a bit more cumbersome. The idea is that (barring quite a few details) if one can solve both~\autoref{problem:mean:testing:standard} and~\autoref{problem:cov:test:norm:frob}, one can solve~\autoref{problem:tv:general} as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item use the algorithm for~\autoref{problem:mean:testing:standard} to detect if $\normtwo{\mu}\gtrsim \dst$ (and ``reject'' if it is the case)
    \item use the algorithm for~\autoref{problem:cov:test:norm:frob} to detect if $\norm{\Sigma-I_\dims}_F\gtrsim \dst$ (and ``reject'' if it is the case), \emph{but} on new samples of the form $X'\eqdef \frac{X-Y}{\sqrt{2}}$, where $X,Y\sim\p$. This transformation increases the number of samples needed by a factor $2$, but as a result the distribution of those new samples is $\gaussian{\mathbf{0}}{\Sigma}$ (the mean $\mu$ cancels out, the covariance is preserved).
    \item if both tests pass, declare $\p=\q$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Overall, this allows us to distinguish between $\p=\q$ and $\max(\normtwo{\mu},\norm{\Sigma-I_\dims}_F) \ll \dst$, which by~\autoref{fact:tv:parameters} is enough to solve~\autoref{problem:tv:general}.
\end{remark}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The proofs, and where to find them}
Given all the relations between problems outlined in the previous section, we don't have as many upper bound lower bounds to prove as one would fear: at least, much fewer that 10 upper and 10 lower bounds.

\begin{itemize}
  \item 
The $\bigOmega{\sqrt{\dims}/\dst^2}$ lower bound for~\autoref{problem:tv:identitycov} is considered folklore, and can be shown, e.g., by Le Cam's two-point method, considering the $2^\dims$ distributions 
\[
    \p_z \eqdef \gaussian{\frac{2\dst}{\sqrt{\dims}}z}{I_\dims}, z\in\{-1,1\}^\dims\,.
\]
Each such $\p_z$ has mean with $\lp[2]$ norm exactly $2\dst$, so an algorithm for~\autoref{problem:tv:identitycov} should allow us to distinguish them from the standard Gaussian $\q$. Even more, if $\ns$ samples are enough for the task, it should allow us to distinguish between the mixture $\frac{1}{2^\dims} \sum_{z\in\{-1,1\}^\dims} \p_z^{\otimes \ns}$ (pick one $\p_z$ uniformly at random, draw $\ns$ samples from it) and $\gaussian{\mathbf{0}}{I_{\dims}}^{\otimes \ns}$ ($\ns$ samples from the standard Gaussian). This in turn can be shown to require $\ns=\bigOmega{\sqrt{\dims}/\dst^2}$ samples (see, for instance,~\cite[Chapter~23]{Wu17}).
  \item
The $\bigO{\sqrt{\dims}/\dst^2}$ upper bound for~\autoref{problem:mean:identitycov} is also ``folklore,''\footnote{Meaning it is awfully hard to track down a published reference for it, as nobody appears to know any but will swear there must be dozens.} but is achieved by the empirical estimator (considering the squared $\lp[2]$ norm of the empirical estimator, that is, $\normtwo{\frac{1}{\ns}\sum_{i=1}^\ns X^{(j)}}^2$, and doing an expectation+variance+Chebyshev analysis). The analysis is not horrendous, although my preference is to divide the $\ns$ samples in two sets $(X^{(j)})_{j=1}^{\ns/2}$ and $(Y^{(j)})_{j=1}^{\ns/2}$ and to use the estimator $\frac{2}{\ns}\sum_{i=1}^{\ns/2} \dotprod{X^{(j)}}{Y^{(j)}}$. I find the computations cleaner.
  \item
The $\bigO{\sqrt{\dims}/\dst^2}$ upper bound for~\autoref{problem:mean:testing:standard} is, oddly, very recent, and can be found in~\cite[Section~4]{CanonneCKLW19}. I find that proof rather suprising and cute.

  \item
The $\bigO{\dims/\dst^2}$ upper and lower bound for~\autoref{problem:mean:identitycov:learn} (a question also known as Gaussian Location Model, or GLM) have many proofs, but I strongly recommend~\cite[Section~9.1]{Wu17}, which provides a more general statement and establishes it in an incredibly elegant way.

  \item
The $\bigOmega{\dims/\dst^2}$ lower bounds for~\autoref{problem:cov:learn:norm:op} and~\autoref{problem:cov:test:norm:frob} both follow from the difficult to distinguish between an identity-covariance matrix and one perturbed by a scaled rank-one matrix, i.e., of the form $I_\dims+\eta vv^\top$. Note that this is a testing (distinguishing) problem for the operator norm, so that implies the same lower bound for~\autoref{problem:cov:learn:norm:op} (estimating that norm) and~\autoref{problem:cov:test:norm:frob} (testing in Frobenius, but Frobenius upper bounds operator norm). This lower bound, proven via Le Cam's two-point method combined with Ingster's method,\footnote{A fancy way to state we upper bound $\chi^2$ distances in a clever (and very useful to know) fashion.} can be found, e.g., in~\cite[Section~24.2]{Wu17}.\footnote{Really, Yihong Wu's lecture notes are a treasure trove.}
  \item
The $\bigO{\dims/\dst^2}$ upper bound for~\autoref{problem:cov:learn:op} can also be found in~\cite[Section~24.2]{Wu17}, and is achieved by the ``obvious'' estimator: the empirical covariance matrix $\widehat{\Sigma}\eqdef \frac{1}{\ns}\sum_{j=1}^\ns X^{(j)}{X^{(j)}}^\top$. A more detailed reference (and a very good one!) for that upper bound is~\cite[Chapter~4.7]{Vershynin18}.
  \item
The $\bigO{\dims/\dst^2}$ and $\bigO{\kappa^2\dims/\dst^2}$ upper bounds for~\autoref{problem:cov:test:norm:frob} and~\autoref{problem:cov:learn:norm:frob} can be found or follow from~\cite{CaiM13}; they are achieved by a unbiased statistic for $\norm{\Sigma-I_\dims}_F^2 = \operatorname{Tr}\mleft((\Sigma-I_\dims)^2\mright)$.
  \item
  All that remains are the $\bigO{\dims^2/\dst^2}$ upper and lower bounds for~\autoref{problem:cov:learn:frob}. I am not sure which reference is best, but~\cite[Section~4.2.2]{DiakonikolasKKLMS16}, or~\cite[Corollary~2.1.12]{Li2018} both show that the upper bound is achieved (again) by the empirical covariance $\widehat{\Sigma}\eqdef \frac{1}{\ns}\sum_{j=1}^\ns X^{(j)}{X^{(j)}}^\top$. I am still tracking down a self-contained reference for the lower bound.
\end{itemize}
